And if you want to get really crazy, even tables:

Wild Header | Crazy Header | Another Header?
------------ | ------------- | ------------- 
Your content can | be here, and it | can be here....

  - Some are bulleted.
     - With different indentation levels.
        - That look like this.

- Even if you use dashes or asterisks.
* And last but not least, let's not forget embedded images:
