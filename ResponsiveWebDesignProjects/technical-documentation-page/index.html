			<header>Definition of Javascript</header>
				<article>
			<p>JavaScript was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages in the
Netscape Navigator browser. The language has since been adopted by all other
major graphical web browsers. It has made modern web applications possible—
applications with which you can interact directly without doing a page reload
for every action. JavaScript is also used in more traditional websites to provide
various forms of interactivity and cleverness.</p>
<p>
	It is important to note that JavaScript has almost nothing to do with the
programming language named Java.
</p>

<section id="Variables" class="main-section">
		<header>Variables</header>
		<article>
			<p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules:</p>
<p>

<ol>
	<li>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($)</li>
	<li>subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9)</li>
	<li> Because <b>JavaScript is case sensitive,</b> letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</li>
</ol>


<h2>Declaring variables </h2>
<p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
<ol>
	<li>With the keyword var. For example, <i> var x = 42.</i> This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</li>
	<li>By simply assigning it a value. For example, <i>x = 42.</i>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning</li>
	<li> And <i>let y = 13.</i>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.

</li>
</ol>

<h2>Variable scope</h2>
<p><b>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable,</b> because it is available to any other code in the current document. <b>When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable,</b> because it is available only within that function.</p>

<p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.
</p>

<code>if (true) { 
  var x = 5;
}
console.log(x);  // 5</code>

<p>The words var and const can also be used to create bindings, in a way similar
to let.</p>

<code>var name = "Ayda";
const greeting = "Hello ";
console.log(greeting + name);
// → Hello Ayda</code>

<p>The first, var (short for “variable”), is the way bindings were declared in
pre-2015 JavaScript. I’ll get back to the precise way it differs from let in the
next chapter. For now, remember that it mostly does the same thing, but we’ll
rarely use it in this book because it has some confusing properties.
The word const stands for constant. It defines a constant binding, which
points at the same value for as long as it lives. This is useful for bindings that
give a name to a value so that you can easily refer to it later.</p>

				<section id="Types_of_variables" class="main-section">
			<header>Types of variables</header>
			<article>
			<h2>Numbers</h2>
			<p>Values of the number type are numeric values. In a JavaScript
program, they are written as follows:</p>
<code>13</code>
<p>Fractional numbers are written by using a dot. Like example:
</p>
<code>9.81</code>
<p>For very big or very small numbers, you may also use scientific notation by
adding an e (for exponent), followed by the exponent of the number.
</p>
<code>2.998e8 That is 2.998 × 108 = 299,800,000.</code>

<h2>Strings</h2>

<p>The next basic data type is the string. Strings are used to represent text. They
are written by enclosing their content in quotes.</p>
<code>`Down on the sea`</code>
<code>"Lie on the ocean"</code>
<code>'Float on the ocean'</code>
<p>You can use single quotes, double quotes, or backticks to mark strings, as
long as the quotes at the start and the end of the string match.</p>

<p>Strings cannot be divided, multiplied, or subtracted, but the + operator can
be used on them. It does not add, but it concatenates—it glues two strings
together. The following line will produce the string "concatenate":</p>
<code> "con" + "cat" + "e" + "nate"</code>

<h2>Boolean values</h2>

<p>
	It is often useful to have a value that distinguishes between only two possibilities,
like “yes” and “no” or “on” and “off”. For this purpose, JavaScript has a
Boolean type, which has just two values, true and false, which are written as
those words.
</p>

<h3>Comparison</h3>
<p>Here is one way to produce Boolean values:</p>
<code>console.log(3 > 2) // → true</code>
	

<h3>Logical operators</h3>
<p>There are also some operations that can be applied to Boolean values themselves.
JavaScript supports three logical operators: and, or, and not. These
can be used to “reason” about Booleans.</p>

<p>The && operator represents logical and. It is a binary operator, and its result
is true only if both the values given to it are true.</p>

<code>console.log(true && false) // → false</code>
<code>console.log(true && true) // → true</code>
	
<p>The || operator denotes logical or. It produces true if either of the values
given to it is true.</p>

<code>console.log(true || false) // → true</code>
<code>console.log(false || false) // → false</code>

<p>Not is written as an exclamation mark (!). It is a unary operator that flips
the value given to it—!true produces false, and !false gives true.</p>

<p>The last logical operator I will discuss is not unary, not binary, but ternary,
operating on three values. It is written with a question mark and a colon, like
this:</p>

<code>console.log(true ? 1 : 2); // → 1</code>
<code>console.log(false ? 1 : 2); // → 2</code>

<p>The value on the
left of the question mark “picks” which of the other two values will come out.
When it is true, it chooses the middle value, and when it is false, it chooses the
value on the right.</p>	

<h2>Empty values</h2>

<p>There are two special values, written <i>null</i> and <i>undefined</i>, that are used to
denote the absence of a meaningful value. They are themselves values, but
they carry no information.</p>
</article>
</section>

<section id="Function" class="main-section">
	<header>Function</header>
	<article>
	<p>Functions are the bread and butter of JavaScript programming. The concept
of wrapping a piece of program in a value has many uses. It gives us a way
to structure larger programs, to reduce repetition, to associate names with
subprograms, and to isolate these subprograms from each other.</p>
<p>The most obvious application of functions is defining new vocabulary. Creating
new words in prose is usually bad style. But in programming, it is
indispensable.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>Defining a function</h2>

<p>
A function definition is a regular binding where the value of the binding is
a function. For example, this code defines square to refer to a function that
produces the square of a given number:
</p>

<code>const square = function(x) {
return x * x;
};
console.log(square(12));
// → 144</code>

<p>A function is created with an expression that starts with the keyword function
. Functions have a set of parameters (in this case, only x) and a body, which
contains the statements that are to be executed when the function is called.
The function body of a function created this way must always be wrapped in
braces, even when it consists of only a single statement.</p>

<p>A function can have multiple parameters or no parameters at all. In the
following example, makeNoise does not list any parameter names, whereas power
lists two:</p>

<code>
const makeNoise = function() {
console.log("Pling!");
};
makeNoise();
// → Pling!
const power = function(base, exponent) {
let result = 1;
for (let count = 0; count < exponent; count++) {
result *= base;
}
return result;
};
console.log(power(2, 10));
// → 1024	
</code>

<h2>Declaration notation</h2>
<code>function square(x) {
return x * x;
}</code>
<p>This is a function declaration. The statement defines the binding square and
points it at the given function. It is slightly easier to write and doesn’t require
a semicolon after the function</p>

<h2>Arrow Function</h2>
<code>const power = (base, exponent) => {
let result = 1;
for (let count = 0; count < exponent; count++) {
result *= base;
}
return result;
};</code>
<p>Instead of the function keyword, it uses an arrow (=>) made up of an
equal sign and a greater-than character (not to be confused with the greaterthan-
or-equal operator, which is written >=).</p>


<h2>Optional Arguments</h2>

<p>If you write an = operator after a parameter, followed by an expression, the
value of that expression will replace the argument when it is not given.
For example, this version of power makes its second argument optional. If
you don’t provide it or pass the value undefined, it will default to two, and the
function will behave like square.</p>

<code>function power(base, exponent = 2) {
let result = 1;
for (let count = 0; count < exponent; count++) {
result *= base;
}
return result;
}
console.log(power(4));
// → 16
console.log(power(2, 6));
// → 64</code>

<h2>Closure</h2>

<code>function wrapValue(n) {
let local = n;
return () => local;
}

let wrap1 = wrapValue(1);
let wrap2 = wrapValue(2);
console.log(wrap1());
// → 1
console.log(wrap2());
// → 2</code>

<p>This example defines a function, wrapValue,
that creates a local binding. It then returns a function that accesses and returns
this local binding.</p>
<p>This feature—being able to reference a specific instance of a local binding in
an enclosing scope—is called closure. A function that references bindings from
local scopes around it is called a closure.</p>

<section id="Arrays" class="main-section">
		<header>Arrays</header>
	<article>
		<p>JavaScript lets you create and group together
data in more interesting ways with arrays. An array is
just a list of other JavaScript data values.</p>
<p>Example of array</p>
<code>
	var dinosaurs = [
"T-Rex",
"Velociraptor",
"Stegosaurus",
"Triceratops",
"Brachiosaurus",
"Pteranodon",
"Apatosaurus",
"Diplodocus",
"Compsognathus"
];
</code>

<h2>Accessing an Array’s Elements</h2>

<p>
	When it’s time to access elements in an array, you use square
brackets with the index of the element you want, as you can see
in the following example:
</p>

<code>dinosaurs[0];
"T-Rex"
dinosaurs[3];
"Triceratops"</code>

<p>An index is the number that corresponds to (or matches) the
spot in the array where a value is stored. Just as with strings, the
first element in an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1,
the third at index 2, and so on. That’s why asking for index 0
from the dinosaurs array returns "T-Rex" (which is first in the list),
and index 3 returns "Triceratops" (which is fourth in the list).</p>

<h2>Setting or Changing Elements
in an Array</h2>

<p>You can use indexes in square brackets to set, change, or even add
elements to an array. For example, to replace the first element
in the dinosaurs array ("T-Rex") with "Tyrannosaurus Rex", you could
do this:</p>

<code>dinosaurs[0] = "Tyrannosaurus Rex";
After you’ve done that, the dinosaurs array would look like this:
["Tyrannosaurus Rex", "Velociraptor", "Stegosaurus", "Triceratops",
"Brachiosaurus", "Pteranodon", "Apatosaurus", "Diplodocus",
"Compsognathus"]</code>

<h2>Adding Elements to an Array</h2>

<h3>.push()</h3>
<p>To add an element to the end of an array, you can use the push
method. Add .push to the array name, followed by the element you
want to add inside parentheses, like this:</p>

<code>var animals = [];
animals.push("Cat");
1
animals.push("Dog");
2
animals.push("Llama");
3
animals;
["Cat", "Dog", "Llama"]
animals.length;
3</code>

<h3>.unshift()</h3>

<p>To add an element to the beginning of an array, you can use
.unshift(element), like this:</p>

<code>animals;
["Cat", "Dog", "Llama"]
 animals[0];
"Cat"
animals.unshift("Monkey");
4
animals;
["Monkey", "Cat", "Dog", "Llama"]
animals.unshift("Polar Bear");
5
animals;
["Polar Bear", "Monkey", "Cat", "Dog", "Llama"]
animals[0];
"Polar Bear"
 animals[2];
"Cat"</code>

<h2>Removing Elements from an Array</h2>

<h3>.pop()</h3>
<p>To remove the last element from an array, you can pop it off by
adding .pop() to the end of the array name. The pop method can be
particularly handy because it does two things: it removes the last
element, and it returns that last element as a value. For example,
let’s start with our animals array, ["Polar Bear", "Monkey", "Cat",
"Dog", "Llama"]. Then we’ll create a new variable called lastAnimal
and save the last animal into it by calling animals.pop().</p>

<code>animals;
["Polar Bear", "Monkey", "Cat", "Dog", "Llama"]
 var lastAnimal = animals.pop();
lastAnimal;
"Llama"
animals;
["Polar Bear", "Monkey", "Cat", "Dog"]
 animals.pop();
"Dog"
animals;
["Polar Bear", "Monkey", "Cat"]
w animals.unshift(lastAnimal);
4
animals;
["Llama", "Polar Bear", "Monkey", "Cat"]</code>

<h3>.shift()</h3>
<p>To remove and return the first element of an array, use
.shift():</p>
<code>animals;
["Llama", "Polar Bear", "Monkey", "Cat"]
var firstAnimal = animals.shift();
firstAnimal;
"Llama"
animals;
["Polar Bear", "Monkey", "Cat"]</code>

<p><i>You can use unshift and shift to add and remove items from
the beginning of an array just as you’d use push and pop to add and
remove items from the end of an array.</i></p>

<h2>Adding Arrays</h2>

<p>To add two arrays together to make a new, single array, you can
use firstArray.concat(otherArray). The term concat is short for
concatenate, a fancy computer science word for joining two values
together. The concat method will combine both arrays into a new
array, with the values from firstArray added in front of those from
otherArray.</p>

<p>You can use concat to join more than two arrays together. Just put
the extra arrays inside the parentheses, separated by commas:</p>

<code>var furryAnimals = ["Alpaca", "Ring-tailed Lemur", "Yeti"];
var scalyAnimals = ["Boa Constrictor", "Godzilla"];
var featheredAnimals = ["Macaw", "Dodo"];
var allAnimals = furryAnimals.concat(scalyAnimals, featheredAnimals);
allAnimals;
["Alpaca", "Ring-tailed Lemur", "Yeti", "Boa Constrictor", "Godzilla",
"Macaw", "Dodo"]</code>

<h2>Finding the Index of an Element
in an Array</h2>

<p>To find the index of an element in an array, use .indexOf(element).
Here we define the array colors and then ask for the index
positions of "blue" and "green" with colors.indexOf("blue") and
colors.indexOf("green"). Because the index of "blue" in the array
is 2, colors.indexOf("blue") returns 2. The index of "green" in the
array is 1, so colors.indexOf("green") returns 1.</p>

<code>var colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
colors.indexOf("blue");
2
colors.indexOf("green");
1</code>

<p><i>If the element whose position you ask for is not in the array,
JavaScript returns -1.</i></p>

<p>If the element appears more than once in the array, the indexOf
method will return the first index of that element in the array.</p>

<code>var insects = ["Bee", "Ant", "Bee", "Bee", "Ant"];
insects.indexOf("Bee");
0</code>

<h2>Turning an Array into a String</h2>

<p>You can use .join() to join all the elements in an array together
into one big string.</p>

<code>var boringAnimals = ["Monkey", "Cat", "Fish", "Lizard"];
boringAnimals.join();
"Monkey,Cat,Fish,Lizard"</code>

<p>You can use .join(separator) to do
the same thing, but with your own
chosen separator between each value.
The separator is whatever string
you put inside the parentheses</p>

<code>var boringAnimals = ["Monkey", "Cat", "Fish", "Lizard"];
boringAnimals.join(" - ");
"Monkey - Cat - Fish - Lizard"
boringAnimals.join("*")
"Monkey*Cat*Fish*Lizard"
boringAnimals.join(" sees ")
"Monkey sees Cat sees Fish sees Lizard"</code>

<section id="Objects" class="main-section">
		<header>Objects</header>
<article>
		<p>Objects in JavaScript are very similar to arrays, but
<b>objects use strings instead of numbers to access the
different elements</b>. The strings are called keys or
properties, and the elements they point to are called
values. Together these pieces of information are called
key-value pairs. While arrays are mostly used to
represent lists of multiple things, objects are often used to represent single things with multiple characteristics, or
attributes.</p>

<p>Basic syntax for creating an object:</p>
<code>var cat = {
"legs": 3,
"name": "Harmony",
"color": "Tortoiseshell"
};</code>

<p>When you create an object, the
key goes before the colon (:), and
the value goes after. The colon acts
a bit like an equal sign—the values
on the right get assigned to the
names on the left, just like when
you create variables. In between
each key-value pair, you have to
put a comma. In our example, the commas are at the ends of the
lines—but notice that you don’t need a comma after the last keyvalue
pair (color: "Tortoiseshell"). Because it’s the last key-value
pair, the closing curly bracket comes next, instead of a comma.</p>

<h2>Keys Without Quotes</h2>

<code>
var cat = {
legs: 3,
name: "Harmony",
color: "Tortoiseshell"
};
</code>

<p>JavaScript knows that the keys will always be strings, which
is why you can leave out the quotes. If you don’t put quotes around
the keys, the unquoted keys have to follow the same rules as variable
names: spaces aren’t allowed in an unquoted key, for example.
If you put the key in quotes, then spaces are allowed:</p>

<code> 
var cat = {
legs: 3,
"full name": "Harmony Philomena Snuggly-Pants Morgan",
color: "Tortoiseshell"
};
</code>

<h2>Accessing Values in Objects</h2>

<h3>Square brackets</h3>

<p>You can access values in objects using square brackets, just like
with arrays. The only difference is that instead of the index (a
number), you use the key (a string).</p>

<code>cat["name"];
"Harmony"</code>

<h3>Dot notation</h3>

<p>Instead of typing the key
name in quotes inside square brackets after the object name, we
just use a period, followed by the key, without any quotes. As with
unquoted keys in object literals, this will work only if the key
doesn’t contain any special characters, such as spaces.</p>

<code>cat.name;
"Harmony"</code>

<h3>Objects keys</h3>

<p>Instead of looking up a value by typing its key, say you wanted
to get a list of all the keys in an object. JavaScript gives you an
easy way to do that, using <i>Object.keys():</i></p>

<code>
	var dog = { name: "Pancake", age: 6, color: "white", bark: "Yip yap 
yip!" };
var cat = { name: "Harmony", age: 8, color: "tortoiseshell" };
Object.keys(dog);
["name", "age", "color", "bark"]
Object.keys(cat);
["name", "age", "color"]
</code>

<h2>Adding Values to Objects</h2>

<p>An empty object is just like an empty array, but it uses curly
brackets, { }, instead of square brackets:</p>

<code>var object = {};</code>

<p>You can add items to an object just as you’d add items to an
array, but you use strings instead of numbers:</p>

<code>var cat = {};
cat["legs"] = 3;
cat["name"] = "Harmony";
cat["color"] = "Tortoiseshell";
cat;
{ color: "Tortoiseshell", legs: 3, name: "Harmony" }</code>

<h2>Combining Arrays and Objects</h2>

<code>var dinosaurs = [
{ name: "Tyrannosaurus Rex", period: "Late Cretaceous" },
{ name: "Stegosaurus", period: "Late Jurassic" },
{ name: "Plateosaurus", period: "Triassic" }
];
</code>
<p>To get all the information about the first dinosaur, you can use
the same technique we used before, entering the index in square
brackets:</p>

<code>dinosaurs[0];
{ name: "Tyrannosaurus Rex", period: "Late Cretaceous" }</code>

<p>If you want to get only the name of the first dinosaur, you can
just add the object key in square brackets after the array index:</p>

<code>dinosaurs[0]["name"];
"Tyrannosaurus Rex"</code>

<p>Or, you can use dot notation, like this:</p>

<code>dinosaurs[1].period;
"Late Jurassic"</code>

<p><b>***You can use dot notation only with objects, not with arrays. </b></p>


<h2>The delete operator </h2>
<p>The delete operator cuts off a tentacle from such an octopus. It is a unary
operator that, when applied to an object property, will remove the named
property from the object. This is not a common thing to do, but it is possible.</p>

<code>
	let anObject = {left: 1, right: 2};
console.log(anObject.left);
// → 1
delete anObject.left;
console.log(anObject.left);
// → undefined
console.log("left" in anObject);
// → false
console.log("right" in anObject);
// → true
</code>

<h2>Object.assign</h2>

<p>let objectA = {a: 1, b: 2};
Object.assign(objectA, {b: 3, c: 4});
console.log(objectA);
// → {a: 1, b: 3, c: 4}</p>

<h2>The Math object</h2>

<p>Math is a grab bag of number-related utility functions, such as
Math.max (maximum), Math.min (minimum), and Math.sqrt (square root).</p>

<h3>Math.random</h3>

<p>This is a function that returns a
new pseudorandom number between zero (inclusive) and one (exclusive) every
time you call it.</p>

<code>// → 0.36993729369714856
75
console.log(Math.random());
// → 0.727367032552138
console.log(Math.random());
// → 0.40180766698904335</code>

<p>If we want a whole random number instead of a fractional one, we can use
Math.floor (which rounds down to the nearest whole number) on the result of
Math.random.</p>

<code>console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 10));
// → 2</code>

<p>Multiplying the random number by 10 gives us a number greater than or
equal to 0 and below 10. Since Math.floor rounds down, this expression will
produce, with equal chance, any number from 0 through 9.
There are also the functions Math.ceil (for “ceiling”, which rounds up to
a whole number), Math.round (to the nearest whole number), and Math.abs,
which takes the absolute value of a number, meaning it negates negative values
but leaves positive ones as they are.</p>

 <h2>Writing the code in your HTML</h2>
<p>Here we’ve added a new element, called script. This is a special
element in HTML. With most HTML elements, the content
between the opening and closing tags is displayed on the page.
With script, on the other hand, everything between the tags is
treated as JavaScript and run by the JavaScript interpreter.
Now let’s look at the code inside the script element:</p>

 <h2>Using the script tag to include an external JavaScript file</h2>

 <p>To include an external JavaScript file, we can use the script tag with the attribute src. You've already used the src attribute when using images. The value for the src attribute should be the path to your JavaScript file.</p>

<code><script type="text/javascript" src="path-to-javascript-file.js"></script>
</code>

<p>This script tag should be included between the <head> tags in your HTML document.

<section id="Conditional_and_loops" class="main-section">
		<header>Conditional and loops</header>
<article>
<h2>If statement</h2>

<p>The if statement is the simplest of JavaScript’s control structures.
It’s used to run code only if a condition is true.</p>

<code>
 var name = "Nicholas";
 console.log("Hello " + name);
 if (name.length > 7) {
 console.log("Wow, you have a REALLY long name!");
</code>

<p>An if statement has two main parts: the
condition and the body. The condition should be a Boolean value.
The body is one or more lines of JavaScript code, which are executed
if the condition is true.</p>

<h2>if…else Statements</h2>

<p>If you want something else to happen when
the condition is false, you need to use an if...else statement.
Let’s extend the example from earlier:</p>

<code>
var name = "Nicholas";
console.log("Hello " + name);
if (name.length > 7) {
console.log("Wow, you have a REALLY long name!");
} else {
console.log("Your name isn't very long.");
}
</code>

<p>This does the same thing as before, except
that if the name isn’t longer than seven characters,
it prints out an alternative message.
If...else statements look like if statements, but with two bodies. The
keyword else is placed between the two bodies.
In an if...else statement, the first body is run
if the condition is true; otherwise, the second
body is run.</p>

<h2>Chaining if…else Statements</h2>

<code>
var lemonChicken = false;
var beefWithBlackBean = true;
var sweetAndSourPork = true;
if (lemonChicken) {
console.log("Great! I'm having lemon chicken!");
} else if (beefWithBlackBean) {
console.log("I'm having the beef.");
} else if (sweetAndSourPork) {
console.log("OK, I'll have the pork.");
} else {
console.log("Well, I guess I'll have rice then.");
}

<p>To create a chain of if...else statements, start with a normal
if statement and, after the closing brace of its body, enter the
keywords else if, followed by another condition and another body.
You can keep doing this until you run out of conditions; there’s no
Conditionals and Loops 95
limit to the number of conditions. The final else section will run if
none of the conditions is true.</p>

<h2>Loops</h2>

<h3>while Loops</h3>

<p>A while loop repeatedly
executes its body until a particular condition stops being true. By
writing a while loop, you are saying, “Keep doing this while this
condition is true. Stop when the condition becomes false.”</p>

<code>
var sheepCounted = 0;
while (sheepCounted < 10) {
console.log("I have counted " + sheepCounted + " sheep!");
sheepCounted++;
}
console.log("Zzzzzzzzzzz");

/*
I have counted 0 sheep!
I have counted 1 sheep!
I have counted 2 sheep!
I have counted 3 sheep!
I have counted 4 sheep!
I have counted 5 sheep!
I have counted 6 sheep!
I have counted 7 sheep!
I have counted 8 sheep!
I have counted 9 sheep!
Zzzzzzzzzzz*/

<p><i>Preventing Infinite Loops: when you’re using loops: if the condition you
set never becomes false, your loop will loop forever (or at least
until you quit your browser).</i></p>

<h3>For Loops</h3>

<p>When setting up a for loop, you create
a variable, specify the condition, and say how the variable should
change after each cycle—all before you reach the body of the loop.</p>

<code>
var timesToSayHello = 3;
for (var i = 0; i < timesToSayHello; i++) {
console.log("Hello!");
}
Here is the output:
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
</code>

<p>If we were the JavaScript interpreter running this code, we
would first create a variable called timesToSayHello and set it to
3. When we reach the for loop, we run the setup, which creates a
variable i and sets it to 0. Next, we check the condition. Because
i is equal to 0 and timesToSayHello is 3, the condition is true, so we
enter the loop body, which simply outputs the string "Hello!". We
then run the increment, which increases i to 1.
Now we check the condition again. It’s still true, so we run
the body and increment again. This happens repeatedly until i is
equal to 3. At this point, the condition is false (3 is not less than 3),
so we exit the loop.</p>

<h3>Using for Loops with Arrays and Strings</h3>

<p>One very common use of for loops is to do something with every
element in an array or every character in a string. For example,
here is a for loop that prints out the animals in a zoo:</p>

<code>
var animals = ["Lion", "Flamingo", "Polar Bear", "Boa Constrictor"];
for (var i = 0; i < animals.length; i++) {
console.log("This zoo contains a " + animals[i] + ".");
}

/*Running this would output:
This zoo contains a Lion.
This zoo contains a Flamingo.
This zoo contains a Polar Bear.
This zoo contains a Boa Constrictor.*/
</code>

<p>Another example:</p>

<code>
var name = "Nick";
for (var i = 0; i < name.length; i++) {
console.log("My name contains the letter " + name[i] + ".");
}
This would output:
My name contains the letter N.
My name contains the letter i.
My name contains the letter c.
My name contains the letter k.
</code>

<h3>Other Ways to Use for Loops</h3>

<p>As you might imagine, you don’t always have to start the looping
variable at 0 and increment it by 1. For example, here’s a way to
print all the powers of 2 below the number 10,000:</p>

<code>
for (var x = 2; x < 10000; x = x * 2) {
console.log(x);
}
